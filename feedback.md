## General
Although when running the app (npm run dev) there is little functionality (I apreciate this is a work in progress) I can see you have a lot of the parts ready and waiting to be pieced together.


## Good
General understanding of React is good. You have an understanding of how to create and put together components along with importing and exporting. You can clearly can use hooks too. And you have some good general problem solving eg  ```const [trackCurrentWord, setTrackCurrentWord] = useState("_ ".repeat(wordToGuess.length)) ``` along with how to build up the hangman picture seems to be going in a good direction. Also great to see you experiementing with other packages eg the random word generator

## Room for Improvment
Hard to offer much here as the app isn't functional (I get it - time slips away and you are not expected to finish üëç). As such I would just say continue in the direction you already seem to be going.
